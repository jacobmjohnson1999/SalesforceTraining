User Creation
When you create a USer (someone that can log in to your salesforce org) you must do a few things

They will need:

Name
Email
username
alias
License 
profile
role (kinda)
A License is a tool that is used to grant access to features in your org, their are many types of licenses

 

States of a user

Active: means you can log in business as usual
Frozen: Means you cannot log in, but you still have your license
Locked: means your tried too many times to log in and you must wait x amount of time or contact your admin
Deactivated: Means you can't log in and you no longer have a license, this is meant for someone who leaves your company 
How security levels influence each other
If you can't access the org you can't access objects fields or records

If you can't read and object, you cannot read its fields, you cannot read anyone's records of that object despite the sharing model

If you cannot edit an Object, you cannot edit any fields or anyone's records despite the sharing model
