Additional Org configuration

Trusted Ips and MFA
MFA: Multi-factor Authentication 

Salesforce gives the ability to enable mfa for our users, it is enabled on the profile level

Once you've enabled mfa for a profile you can then configure that profiles trusted Ip ranges: this functions as a subset of ips from which a user won't have to use MFA





Chatter
a communication channel inside of Salesforce, it looks a whole lot like twitter.
It exists is to streamline communication between coworkers
Chatter allows us to create posts, polls, and questions that can be related to a record or just in a chatter group
Posts look a whole lot like twitter, # signifies a topic in chatter, we can @ other users
You can follow users and records
Anything that you follow will appear in your feed as well as posts in groups that you are part of
To allow following you first must make that object enable chatter feed tracking, then in chatter feed tracking you must enable it again on the object and then you can pick the fields you want changes to appear in your chatter feed
Chatter Group

are meant to be a place where related users can work together and collaborate
Public: anyone can post and read posts that are made in this group even if you aren't a member
Private:anyone can see this group, only members can read or add posts but you can ask to join
Unlisted: you have to be invited and if you aren't you won't even know this group exists


Activities
Are tasks and Events and they aren't separate objects because salesforce is weird
If you want to add a new field to the task object or event object you actually have to modify the activity object
When we allow activities we allow there to be tasks and events related to that object
Tasks: are to do list items or sticky notes
Events: are going to be things like meetings, conferences, parties, ect.. things you go to that have a time duration
