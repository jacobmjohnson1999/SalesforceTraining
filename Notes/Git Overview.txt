Git
What is it?

distributed version control system for tracking changes to source code made while developing
the entire codebase and history of a project is available on a developer's computer as a local repo
allows for easy branching and merging of those branches
local repo contains all information that the remote repo had the last time they synced
used for organizing and integrating code written by multiple developers
GitHub

cloud-based git repo hosting service
it allows us to host our remote repo
git is a command line(CLI) tool, Github is a web-based GUI
Git commands
Initializing a Repo

git init: it initializes a local repo, it creates a .git/ directory in the directory that you run the command in


working directory: is where all untracked files and files that have been changed since the last commit exist
Staging area: is the holding area for code we will eventually commit to our repo
to see the file in the working directory you can use the command git status
To add a file to the staging are you use the command git add nameoffiletoadd.extension or if you want to add all changed files to the staging area you can do git add .
To commit the changes to the local repo you use the command git commit -m"Commit Message"
To push changes from the local repo to the remote repo we use the command git push
If we want to clone a remote repository on to our machine, we use the command git clone https://.......
Branching

the main/master/default branch of your repo is meant to hold production ready code, this is so you can have one source of truth for your code
Branching allows you to create a different timeline of commits for your project
When you branch you take a snapshot of ther source branch at that time and clone it to have a new location to develope code in

typically branches are used to separate out concerns/features
